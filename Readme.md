A game of chess for the console written in C++.

This is an early version. Currently winning is only possible by taking the enemies king.
There might be some errors that need fixing.

Currently (more or less) working:
- Drawing of unicode chess board
- Parsing of input
- Info about last taken action
- Movement logic for all pieces
- en passant

Plans for the future:
- add a proper check for mate
- check if the king is under attack
- make castling possible
- promotion of pawns that reach the opposing home row
